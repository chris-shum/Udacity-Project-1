##Popular Movies

###Overview:

Popular Movies features [The Movie DB's API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).  The app displays a list of movies in a RecyclerView sorted by popularity or rating.  I also added the feature to query movies for said categories by year.  The app was formatted to work in both portrait and landscape mode.
